<p> The word'computer' comes from the word compute means 'to calculate' computers were developed from calculators to a more complex calculating machine, invented by different scientist who are called fathers of computer.</p>


<h2>FIRST GENERATION(1940-1956) VACUUM TUBES</h2>

<p> The first computers used vacuum tubes for circuitry and magnetic drums for memory. First generation computers relied on machine language the lowest level programming language understood by computers to perform operatios and they could only solve one problem at a time.</p>

<h2> The inventor  during first Generation</h2>

<ul >
<li>John Mauchly</li>
<li> Presper Eckert</li>
<li> John Von Neumann </li>
</ul>


<h2>SECOND GENERATION (1956-1963) TRANSISTOR</h2>

<p> A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify and switch electronic signals and electriy power. It is composed of semiconductor material with at least three terminals for connection to an external circuit</p>

<h2> The inventor  during Second Generation</h2>

<ul >
<li>William Shockley</li>
<li> Walter Brattain</li>
</ul>

<h2>THIRD GENERATION (1964-1971) INTEGRATED CIRCUITS</h2>

<p> An integrated circuit or monolithic integrated circuit (also referred to as ic,chip,or microchip) is an electronic circuit manufactured by the patterned diffusion of trace elements into the surface of a thin substrate of semiconductor material</p>

<h2> The inventor during Third Generation</h2>

<ul >
<li> Jack Kilby</li>
<li> Robert Noyce</li>
</ul>

<h2> FOURTH GENERATION (1971-PRESENT) MICROPROCESSOR</h2>

<p>The microprocessor brought the fourth generation of computers that could fit on the palm of the hand. Microprocessor also moved out of the realm of desktop computers</p>

<h2> The inventor  during Fourth Generation</h2>

<ul >
<li> Ted Hoff</li>
</ul>



<h2> FIFTH GENERATION (PRESENT AND BEYOND) ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h2>

<p>Fifth generation computers are in developed stage which is based on the artificial intelligence </p>

<h2> The inventor  during Fifth Generation</h2>

<ul >
<li> John McCarthy</li>
</ul>

<h2> SIXTH GENERATION ROBOTICS </h2>

<p>It is  an enhancement of the fifth generation, the AI Robotics is a concept  in programming which enables the device to think and take actions on their own. The  sixth generation of computers is said to have a good resemblance of the human brain</p>
